Easy to set up [SpongeForge](https://www.spongepowered.org/). However, please agree to [the Minecraft End User License Agreement](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula) by yourself.

### Setup Sponge Forge

Move the sponge folder and execute the following command.

```sh
./setup.sh
```

Download MinecraftForge and SpongeForge. **If the data folder already exists, it is zipped and moved to the backup folder.** Finally MinecraftForge installation will be done. You need to agree to the EULA in order to run the server. Go to eula.txt for more info.

### Run the Server

```sh
./run.sh
```
